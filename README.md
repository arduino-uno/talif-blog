### About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)](https://example.com)

Talif is a simple CMS for easy blogging. It uses AdminLTE for Admin Panel & Dashboard. Talif is Easy to Install, after installation go to '/login.php' and you can login to the dashboard to do everything form creating a blog post or page to setting site preferences or even change Blog Template.

Here's why:

* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

#### Built With
